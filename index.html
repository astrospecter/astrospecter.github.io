                    Welcome to my portfolio! I'm Lina, a senior at Boston University studying Physics and Computer Science. I'm interested in software engineering, 
                    quantum information science/quantum computing, systems architecture, high performance computing, and computational physics. I'm originally from
                    Philadelphia but currently based in Boston.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have work experience from all across the stack, from Full Stack Engineering and UI/UX Design to DevOps Engineering to Quantum Software Engineering.
                    I started my career experiences in cloud computing and I'm branching out from there! In addition to these industry experiences, I was also a teaching
                    assistant to various introductory computer science courses at BU. More detail about my experience can be found below.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    In my spare time, I like to draw and paint, play piano, read, play various video games and board games, and dance. I also dabble in a bit of game development, and I
                    dance as a part of Boston University's classical Chinese dance company, Verge. Other clubs I'm a part of include Women in Computer Science, Girls who Code,
                    Society of Asian Scientists and Engineers, Board Game Club, and Q.
